<p>The Nestless. We must make Treeholes and Nests to help the Nestless! </p>

<p>Nestlings. We must protect the future birds of Bird Nation.
Birds as young as them could die due to malnurishment or extreme tempertures!</p>

<p>OABs. Bird Nation should be a special place for all the birds to come together and create harmony. 
Old Age Birds have seen the horrors done to birds in the past and know more than anyone what is at risk.
We must come together and unite the birds!!!
